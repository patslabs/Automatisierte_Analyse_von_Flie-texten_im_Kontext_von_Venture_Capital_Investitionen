README BUILD A CSV FOR CLUSTERING APPLICATION

This application takes every file in a directory and ads its text to a big .csv file.

***Prerequisites:***
Python 3
Python GUI of your choice (My choice: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)


***Getting started:***
1. Check the prerequisites
2. Start your Python GUI and open the file "build a csv for clustering.py"
3. Check that you have a directory in which your .txt files are saved that you want to cluster. Do not include ANY other file in that directory. Only the .txt files.
4. Set the necessary variables, provided at the bottom of the application to what fits to your PC.
	"directory" is the directory in which you have your .txt files saved. Your csv file will be saved there as well.
	"file_name_to_save" is the name of the .csv file that will be created. Take a new name and add ".csv" at the end.
5. Run the application and find your .csv file in the directory that you specified within the variables.
